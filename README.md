# üéÆ Backloggery Priority Manager

**Backloggery Priority Manager** is a tool designed to help gamers decide *what to play next* from their game library. You import your backlog as a `.csv` file, then the app guides you toward the best game to play based on your progress and goals.

## ‚ú® Features

* Upload your game library (`library.csv`)
* Set how far you've progressed in each game (completion percentage)
* Define how much you *want* to finish a game
* Get a ranked list of suggested games to play next, calculated based on your input

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is an early version and currently must be run via an IDE (such as VS Code or PyCharm).

1. Export your game library as `library.csv`
2. Place the file in the **same folder** as `main.py`
3. Open the project in your IDE and run `main.py`

The program will launch a window where you can enter your completion data and see your ranked list of games.
